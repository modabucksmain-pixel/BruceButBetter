```

---

A hand-built Flipper Zero on the ESP32-S3 N16R8. This repository is a downstream fork of the
[Bruce](https://github.com/pr3y/Bruce) firmware, adapted to custom hardware: shared SPI/I²C backbone,
dual USB-C, and an added Si5351 signal-generator module. One binary covers every populated chip.

## 🔧 Build one yourself (~$40)

Want this device? The full **[DIY build guide →](./docs/BUILD.md)** has the bill of materials with
purchase links, a wiring diagram, step-by-step assembly, and one-click flashing. Start with the
ESP32-S3 + screen + buttons (~$13), add radios when you want them.

| Tier | Parts | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum (UI) | ESP32-S3 + OLED + buttons | ~$13 |
| Recommended | + CC1101 + PN532 + IR + microSD | ~$25 |
| Full | + 2× NRF24 + Si5351 + battery | ~$40 |

## WHAT'S DIFFERENT FROM BRUCE

This is **not** a re-skin. It's a downstream fork built around one purpose-made DIY device, with extra
modules wired in on top of upstream Bruce.

### Purpose-built hardware target — `ESP-General`
- **ESP32-S3 N16R8** (16 MB flash / 8 MB PSRAM), **1.3" SH1106 monochrome OLED** over I²C, dual USB-C.
- Fixed module loadout on a shared SPI/I²C backbone: **CC1101 + PN532 + 2× NRF24 + Si5351 + IR + SD**.
- UI **tuned for 128×64 mono** (status bar / padding shrunk — upstream defaults assume colour TFTs).
- **Trimmed** for the small build: GPS, LoRa, Ethernet and FM are compiled out (`-DDISABLE_*`).
- Upstream's commercial boards (M5Stack / Lilygo / CYD …) are **still build-able** here — see
  [Supported Boards](#supported-boards) — but `ESP-General` is the maintained, build-verified target.

### Added modules (wired into the menus, not in upstream)
| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Si5351 signal generator** | Clean RF 8 kHz–160 MHz on CLK0/1/2, frequency sweep, AM band |
| **NRF24 ESB sniffer** | Capture Enhanced-ShockBurst 2.4 GHz traffic |
| **BLE tracker** | Track/monitor nearby BLE devices |
| **IR replay** | Capture and re-transmit IR signals |
| **RFID key attack** | Key-recovery attack flow on the RFID menu |
| **Custom boot logo** | Branded splash on startup |

### New firmware features (not in upstream)
| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Hardware Self-Test** | Top-level menu that probes the **I²C and SPI buses** and reports every module that answers — OLED/PN532/Si5351/RTC/sensors with `[OK] 0xNN`, plus microSD and both NRF24 radios `[OK]/[--]`. Verify your wiring/soldering in seconds. |
| **Si5351 live calibration** | Outputs a 10 MHz reference on CLK0 and lets you trim the crystal correction (ppb, variable step) live to zero-beat against a known source. |
| **Si5351 favorites** | Save/recall your CLK0 frequencies from RF Gen → *Favorites*; persisted to `/si5351_fav.txt` on LittleFS (survives reboot). |
| **Dual-NRF24 spectrum** | When a second NRF24 is populated, the 2.4 GHz analyzer scans odd channels on radio 2 in parallel with radio 1's even channels — ~2× faster sweep (`2x` badge). Auto-falls back to single radio. |
| **CC1101 peak-hold spectrum** | The sub-GHz RSSI analyzer keeps a peak-hold cap above each bar so brief signals stay on screen, and the Max readout shows the strongest signal's dBm next to its frequency. |

### Packaging
- **One-click [browser flasher](https://Yoursel71.github.io/BruceButBetter/)** — pick **any of 45 boards** and
  flash from the browser (esp-web-tools), no toolchain.
- Device advertises as **`BruceButBetter`** on USB / BLE / screen.

> Everything else tracks upstream [Bruce](https://github.com/pr3y/Bruce); useful changes are meant to flow
> back upstream via PR.

## DOWNLOAD / FLASH

> The **web flasher now flashes any of 45 boards** — pick yours from the board selector and flash from
> the browser (chip family auto-matched per image; no toolchain). The same merged `Bruce-<board>.bin`
> images are on the [latest release](https://github.com/Yoursel71/BruceButBetter/releases/latest) for
> manual `esptool` flashing too. Only the `esp32-c5` variants and `arduino-nesso-n1` build from source.

### Browser flasher (recommended)

**[Yoursel71.github.io/BruceButBetter](https://Yoursel71.github.io/BruceButBetter/)**

Open in desktop Chrome/Edge, **pick your board**, connect via the **left USB-C** (UART), click **Flash**. No toolchain needed.

### Manual

Latest builds: **[Releases](https://github.com/Yoursel71/BruceButBetter/releases/tag/v1.0.0)**

Single file (merged — bootloader + partitions + boot_app0 + firmware, offset `0x0`):

```sh
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port COMx write_flash 0x0 Bruce-esp32-s3-N16R8.bin
```

Separate components:

```sh
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port COMx write_flash \
  0x0      bootloader.bin \
  0x8000   partitions.bin \
  0xe000   boot_app0.bin \
  0x10000  firmware.bin
```

> Linux/Mac: use `/dev/ttyACM0` or `/dev/ttyUSB0` instead of `COMx`. Flash over the **left USB-C** (UART) port.

| File | Offset | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Bruce-esp32-s3-N16R8.bin` | `0x0` | Merged (all-in-one) |
| `bootloader.bin` | `0x0` | Bootloader |
| `partitions.bin` | `0x8000` | Partition table |
| `boot_app0.bin` | `0xe000` | OTA selector |
| `firmware.bin` | `0x10000` | Application |

**Other boards** — the release also has a merged `Bruce-<board>.bin` for 45 targets (Cardputer, CYD,
Lilygo, M5Stack, Marauder, Elecrow …). Flash it the same way; use `--chip esp32` for classic-ESP32
boards or `--chip esp32s3` for S3 boards:

```sh
esptool.py --chip <esp32|esp32s3> --port COMx write_flash 0x0 Bruce-<board>.bin
```

## PINOUT

I²C (shared) — OLED `0x3C`, PN532 `0x24`, Si5351 `0x60`:

```
IO8  = SDA
IO18 = SCL
```

SPI (shared bus) — CC1101 + MicroSD + NRF24 ×2:

```
IO11 = MOSI
IO12 = SCK
IO13 = MISO
```

CS / control pins (unique, no conflict):

```
CC1101    GDO0=IO9   CS=IO10
MicroSD   CS=IO14
NRF24 #1  CE=IO4     CSN=IO5
NRF24 #2  CE=IO6     CSN=IO7
IR        RX=IO1     TX=IO2
Buzzer    IO47
```

Buttons (to GND, pull-up):

```
UP=IO15  DOWN=IO16  LEFT=IO38  RIGHT=IO39  OK=IO40  BACK=IO41
```

**RESERVED — do not use (bricks the board):**

```
GPIO 26-32  -> QSPI Flash
GPIO 33-37  -> OPI PSRAM (forbidden on N16R8)
GPIO 19-20  -> Native USB D+/D- (reserved for Bad USB)
GPIO 45-46  -> Strapping
GPIO 43-44  -> UART0 TX/RX (debug)
```

---

## BUILD FROM SOURCE

Requires [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).

```sh
# Build
pio run -e esp32-s3-devkitc-1-psram

# Build + upload
pio run -e esp32-s3-devkitc-1-psram -t upload

# Serial monitor
pio device monitor
```

Output: `.pio/build/esp32-s3-devkitc-1-psram/firmware.bin`. Active board set by `default_envs` in `platformio.ini`.

> **One binary, mixed hardware** — modules are probed at runtime. A missing chip shows a "not found"
> message and returns to the menu instead of crashing. Flash the same binary regardless of which
> optional modules are populated.

---

## SUPPORTED BOARDS

The default build targets the custom **ESP-General** DIY hardware. The **full upstream Bruce board
matrix** is also ported in — build any with `pio run -e <env>`. Common targets:

> ✓ **45 of these ship a prebuilt, ready-to-flash `Bruce-<env>.bin`** in the
> [latest release](https://github.com/Yoursel71/BruceButBetter/releases/latest) — no toolchain needed
> (see [Download / Flash](#download--flash)). Only the `esp32-c5` variants and `arduino-nesso-n1`
> still build from source.

| Board | Build env (`-e`) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **DIY ESP32-S3 N16R8** | `esp32-s3-devkitc-1-psram` | **Primary** — this project's board (default) |
| M5Stack Cardputer | `m5stack-cardputer` | Keyboard handheld (build-verified ✓) |
| M5StickC Plus2 / Plus1.1 | `m5stack-cplus2` / `m5stack-cplus1_1` | Compact stick |
| M5Stack CoreS3 / Core / Core2 | `m5stack-cores3` | Core family |
| M5Stack StickS3 / DinMeter | `m5stack-sticks3` / `m5stack-dinmeter` | |
| CYD (ESP32-2432S028) | `CYD-2432S028` | Cheap Yellow Display; many CYD variants in the `.ini` |
| Lilygo T-Embed CC1101 | `lilygo-t-embed-cc1101` | Built-in Sub-GHz |
| Lilygo T-Deck / T-Watch / T-Display S3 | `lilygo-t-deck` / `lilygo-t-watch-s3` / `lilygo-t-display-s3` | |
| Lilygo T-HMI / T-LoRa-Pager | `lilygo-t-hmi` / `lilygo-t-lora-pager` | |
| ESP32-C5 | `esp32-c5` | Dual-band RISC-V |
| Marauder / Phantom / Reaper / xk404 | `Marauder-Mini` / `Phantom_S024R` / `reaper` / `xk404` | Custom PCBs |

Full list: every dir under [`boards/`](./boards) (run `pio project config` to enumerate envs).

Boards auto-register via the `extra_configs` glob in `platformio.ini` — drop a `boards/<name>/` dir in
and it appears. Pin maps live in each `boards/<name>/pins_arduino.h`; features degrade gracefully when a
chip is absent, so a single build runs across mixed hardware. Adding a board? See [`boards/README.md`](./boards/README.md).

> Board configs are ported from upstream [Bruce](https://github.com/pr3y/Bruce). **ESP-General is the DIY
> target actively maintained and build-verified here** (plus Cardputer); the rest are byte-identical to
> upstream and track it — not individually hardware-tested in this fork.
